   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;An abridged version of a talk by Guy Stroumsa at a conference held in his honour in Jerusalem&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/_posts/zeevveez.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;zeevveez.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me, a &lt;em&gt;révolutionnaire manqué&lt;/em&gt;, the comparative study of religions and their cohort of dreams of transformations, of patterns of mutations, both within societies and inside the self, has always represented a deeply subversive activity. I wish to offer here a midrashic reflection of sorts on subversion as an intellectual and moral duty: that of refusing to lie on the Procrustean beds prepared for us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the last half-century, the Hebrew University has been a true home for me, one which I never really left. A &lt;em&gt;witz&lt;/em&gt; describes psychoanalysts as people whose analysis was not quite successful: they were not able to move ahead. &lt;em&gt;Mutatis mutandis&lt;/em&gt;, the same could be said about professors and their education. The very first day of my new life in Israel, in July 1966 (I was eighteen, as old as the country), was also that of my baptismal day as a student at the Hebrew University – more precisely, at its summer Ulpan: the early stages of my interminable struggle with Hebrew. Like other ambitious universities, the Hebrew University has always known that its first, absolute commitment was to the search of truth and to what it entails: critical thought, moral backbone, intellectual freedom. The intellectual audacity expected from universities is worthless without the civic courage to constantly question thought patterns and attitudes current in their own societies, to affirm, clearly and loudly, their autonomy and independence from the bodies and governments funding them. In Rabelais’ lapidary dictum: “Science sans conscience n’est que ruine de l’âme.” This permanent questioning is, precisely, their duty of subversion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, paradoxically, universities are everywhere under threat, asked to ‘be relevant,’ rather than to search for truth, to ‘deliver’ rather than to educate. I say paradoxically, as human societies, despite blatant, shocking inequalities, have never been as affluent as they are today. I cannot analyze this paradox here or even attempt to suggest solutions. I want at least to stress what you all know, that Faculties of Humanities are much more seriously threatened that those of Sciences and vocational schools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The natural sciences have an easier time, I think, in their rebuttal of utilitarian demands, as it is relatively simple for them to show the value of pure research: no applied mathematics or physics without pure mathematics and physics. At least in theory, one can still make an argument about &lt;em&gt;la science pour la science&lt;/em&gt;, as one does about &lt;em&gt;l’art pour l’art&lt;/em&gt;. A similar argument is far less obvious for the humanities. Very soon, one will hear the argument about what the Germans call the &lt;em&gt;kleine Fächer&lt;/em&gt;, the “small fields,” such as, at least in the Israeli context, the paradigmatic Assyriology: too expensive, too few students. And besides, who cares about Assyriology?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem, I fear, is made more complex by the fact that the humanities, the &lt;em&gt;Geisteswissenschaften&lt;/em&gt;, in their wish to be taken seriously, have calqued themselves on the &lt;em&gt;Naturwissenschaften&lt;/em&gt;. They are still doing that, as shown by the latest fad, “digital humanities,” and by the widely spread tendency to value only what can be quantified. I am all for the use of modern technologies in the service of the humanities, but at the moment, the technologies seem to take over the fields rather than serve them. Faculties of Humanities risk forgetting that their task, beyond producing new knowledge, also consists in offering a reflection on knowledge, on its conditions, its limits and its meaning. Such a second-order reflection is essentially subversive, as it questions the natural acceptance of existing conditions for the reproduction of knowledge in society, including in its educational institutions, and in the political system sustaining them. The humanities are deeply unsettling, and therefore, in this age of increasing resistance to questioning, increasingly unfashionable. By historicizing and relativizing all ideas and world-views, they disturb what is held sacred in all quarters. It is, then, by nature that the humanities, more than any other branch of knowledge in the universities, are subversive. I would go further, and argue that it is only by recognizing and embracing the subversive nature of their craft that humanists can avoid the new, deeply threatening &lt;em&gt;trahison des clercs&lt;/em&gt;, to borrow the title of Julien Benda’s famous pamphlet, toward which the market forces of the global village almost inexorably push us all. Almost inexorably, but perhaps not quite: if the historian (even the historian of religion) is no prophet, she or he can never be sure that the claim of subversion will only remain a symbolic gesture of protest, done only for honor’s sake. It may also, perchance, hide the seed of a future rebirth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the modern university is a secular place: no theological presupposition, no religious limitation may regulate the questioning of scientists and scholars alike. This, we must reckon, creates a particular problem for the study of religion, a problem that cannot be easily dismissed, although it often goes unrecognized. Creating secular knowledge about the sacred is by no means an obvious task, even when one deals with societies far away from ours in either time or space. Nor is the study of religion, despite appearances, perceived as a problem only by those who have religious leanings, and who may feel that their world, their values, are under attack, perhaps even desecrated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I have come to realize over the years, creating secular knowledge about the sacred is also felt as a threat by the secularists, those who feel enlightened, free from the prejudices and fears so characteristic (they think) of religion. The modern, comparative study of religion is a study of humans, not of gods. More precisely, it is the study of humans dealing with the gods. It is, therefore, more akin to anthropology than to theology. While the study of religion cannot protect religion from the secular invasion (indeed, it reflects and often represents this invasion), it also refuses to evacuate religion from the secular world. In its double movement, the study of religion thus antagonizes both the proponents of a religious worldview and those of a secular one, appearing to both as a threat. No surprise, then, if it is deeply unfashionable. At the same time, it is urgently needed, as it stands at the very core of Faculties of Humanities, encapsulating, as it were, the duty of subversion that is theirs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago, after the last Paris terrorist massacres, a dear friend of mine from Berlin expressed her shock at the speed with which French politicians were switching to a warlike vocabulary. The reticence to speak of war is easily understandable, and highly commendable, certainly on the side of Germans, who can afford historical amnesia even less than others. My immediate reaction to her remark, however, was that I had never considered the world I lived in to be a peaceful one. From the Qumran scroll describing the eschatological War between the Sons of Light with the Sons of Darkness and Mani’s &lt;em&gt;Sermon of the Great War&lt;/em&gt; to more recent bouts of religious violence, in Jamestown, Waco, Ayodhya, Bali, Beirut, New York, Ankara or Bamako, war has always been omnipresent. We know, moreover, that not all Sons of Darkness belong to the enemy camp; some also sit in our midst. For me, then, humanism is conceivable only in a world at war; it must be a fighting humanism. In his theses On the concept of history, written in 1940, Walter Benjamin could say: “the emergency situation in which we live is the rule.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Ultimi barbarorum!” Spinoza’s cry of rage and despair, which he inscribed on a placard when hearing of the lynching of his friends, the De Witt brothers, in 1672, might have cost him his life, had not his lodger wisely locked him up in his room. “Ultimi barbarorum!” This cry resonates today in this impossible city, Jerusalem. Before the end of my first year of studies at the Hebrew University started the Six Day War – a war still going on, almost fifty years later. A life of learning and of teaching under such conditions is something difficult to grasp, and quite hard to sustain, as no university can remain an island of reason in a sea of madness, of honesty in a situation of injustice, certainly not when it stands, and quite concretely so, at the very seam between conqueror and conquered. We have tried seriously, students and teachers alike, to keep our labs, our libraries and our seminar rooms aseptic, as it were, to concentrate on what we were doing, isolated from the world looming right outside our window. &lt;em&gt;Wissenschaft als Beruf&lt;/em&gt;: we have done our best to take Max Weber’s injunction seriously. We have played by the rules of democracy, while a whole people was, and still is being kept under military occupation, without civil rights, now for almost half a century – deprived of its freedom by those whose children read about Israel’s Exodus from Egypt and the books of the prophets in the original biblical Hebrew! For many among us, this has been at times intolerably stressful, unbearably painful. At some point, the bow must break. Under some circumstances, it is in the mode of protest that the duty of the scholar must be expressed. Cultivating the humanities in such a climate does not necessarily entail the splendid isolation of a (more or less) air-conditioned ivory tower. It can also express a potent protest, represent, as it were, a subversive activity against the reigning order. I have long been impressed by what Raja Shehadeh, a Palestinian writer from Ramallah, has called &lt;em&gt;şumūd&lt;/em&gt;, a noble way of resisting daily brutality and the constant rape of the soul by stubbornly sticking to one’s beliefs, way of life, and ethos. Insisting on remaining oneself, on keeping high one’s torch of values in front of politicians lending their support to thugs, ‘thugs for God’s sake,’ one might call them, and transmitting this torch to the youth: there is a real element of subversion here, perhaps even, who knows, a powerful one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are left here with a theologico-political aporia rooted in the very nature of Zionism. Like all movements of national liberation, Zionism achieved its goals, at best, only very partially. Here, the founders of the Hebrew University were quite lucid, aware from the start of the deep-seated ambiguities of the adventure in which they were taking part. I shall mention here only Yehuda Leon Magnes, the first President of the Hebrew University, Martin Buber, the first President of the Israel Academy of Sciences and Humanities, and Gershom Scholem, another President of this Academy. In his magnum opus, a biography of the seventeenth-century false messiah Sabbatai Zevi, first published (in Hebrew) in 1959, Scholem could warn of the explosive mixture of old messianic ideas and modern political ideals. Today, the dialectics of the return to Zion threaten to lead to what is perceived, by too many, as Israel’s ‘manifest destiny’: after the Reconquista of the whole land, the segregation into reserves of the Palestinians, or even their eventual expulsion. The supreme jewel in David’s crown, for them, would be the rebuilding of the Jerusalem Temple and, one imagines, the ensuing restoration of daily blood sacrifices (what else would one do in the Temple?), after a pause of a mere two millenia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is certainly important, and tragically fascinating, to study the sinuous paths through which religious tradition and cultural legacy can - and do - degenerate into such lunacy. This urgent task is that of historians of religion. But it is not our only task, nor is it our most immediate one. If we wish to avoid what might soon lead to nothing less than a conflict of world dimensions, we must also fight the present neo-messianic madness urgently, and furiously. When fair is foul, and foul is fair, civic courage meets intellectual duty, and intellectual courage means civic duty. The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, its Faculty of Humanities, and its students of religion, must be at the front line in this subversive war against the murderous folly threatening our society and our humanity.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Experiments With Books</title>
   <link href="http://roundedglobe.github.io/blog/experiments-with-books/"/>
   <updated>2015-12-07T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>http://roundedglobe.github.io/blog/experiments-with-books</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://roundedglobe.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rounded Globe&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; produces scholarly ebooks that can be read on kindles and tablets. Our ebooks are generated as .epub and .mobi files by an automatic process (designed by our chief technical wizard, Andrew Holgate). At the core of the compiled ebook is a simple .txt file, written in markdown (as is this blog post) and containing the body of the essay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As such, Rounded Globe follows the commercial ebook format rather than the conventional format of academic publishing, which rests on the .pdf file - essentially, a photographic image of a traditional printed page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One advantage of the commercial format is that ebooks can be very easily revised. Instead of waiting for a new edition, the .txt file is tweaked as desired and a new ebook may be automatically generated. This, in effect, negates the very idea of &amp;#39;an edition&amp;#39;, as the ebook is open to continual and open-ended revision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the same logic, of course, an &amp;#39;unfinished&amp;#39; text can readily be compiled as an ebook. In recent weeks Rounded Globe has offered a group of amateur scholars and Tolkien enthusiasts the opportunity to do just this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The group, whose members reside in locations as diverse as Tanzania and Texas, not to mention Cheshire, UK, are co-writing an essay for a forthcoming &lt;a href=&quot;http://sacnoths.blogspot.co.il/2015/05/verlyn-flieger-festschrit-call-for.html&quot;&gt;volume&lt;/a&gt; in honour of the Tolkien scholar Verlyn Flieger. For their discussions and writing they make use of a (free) &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/uoou/AWildernessOfDragons&quot;&gt;github repository&lt;/a&gt;, which allows them to make a Wiki for their project, engage in blog posts, and - crucially - write the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/uoou/AWildernessOfDragons/blob/gh-pages/essay.md&quot;&gt;essay&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Github requires the essay to be written in markdown. This means that at any moment the text of the essay can be copied and pasted into a .txt file and, using the Rounded Globe machinery, transformed into a working ebook that may be read on Kindle or on tablet or simply on the web.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rounded Globe have donated a free &amp;#39;hidden&amp;#39; &lt;a href=&quot;http://roundedglobe.com/download/56421543cf7bc42e04e564b6&quot;&gt;page&lt;/a&gt; for this project. It is &amp;#39;hidden&amp;#39; in the sense that this essay does not show up in our main list of books. But members of the group - in fact, anyone with the url - can download the latest version of the essay as an ebook whenever they want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This Tolkien project is a lot of fun, not least because it facilitates exploration of the possibilities of co-authorship. But it also points to a deeper lesson, namely that electronic text is challenging our entrenched cultural assumptions as to the nature of a book. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This challenge has long been obscured by the default academic turn to pdf ebooks (a typical case of a new technology disguising itself to look - and work - like the old). But our production model at Rounded Globe brings us face to face with the fact that the very idea of a finished and complete book has little real meaning - a book is &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; in a potential process of change and revision; like ourselves, a book that is &amp;#39;finished&amp;#39; is a dead book.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Academic Book Week &amp; Rounded Globe</title>
   <link href="http://roundedglobe.github.io/blog/academic-book-week-&-Rounded-Globe/"/>
   <updated>2015-11-11T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>http://roundedglobe.github.io/blog/academic-book-week-&-Rounded-Globe</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the new Rounded Globe blog. Our first post is a short contribution to the various musings and articles posted online regarding the future of scholarly publications during &lt;strong&gt;Academic Book Week&lt;/strong&gt; (9th – 16th Nov 2015).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Traditionally, academic books were printed monographs: extensive pieces of research, frequently written primarily for specialist audiences in discipline specific jargon. In recent times, though printed books are still popular with many, there has been a huge increase in the number of e-books in academic collections and libraries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In theory, these online publications enable access anytime, anyplace, to anyone; but in practice they yield their gems of wisdom only to those with institutional memberships or with a personal copy of the often costly books. Even with relevant university affiliations, researchers are constrained by the budgets of academic libraries, which are frustrated by their inability to purchase all of the vast array of human research and knowledge their members wish to access.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The open access movement, which has gained some momentum but not entirely overthrown existing publishing practices, aims to further widen access to the increasing selection of electronic resources, by creating new models enabling all scholars, not just those connected to universities, to be able to read digital scholarship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As many articles written for Academic Book Week have mentioned, in addition to traditional publishers creating ebooks and exploring ways of providing open access, and an increased interest in the development of open access university presses, there are also independent initiatives appearing in scholarly publishing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the other end are new entrants defining particular niches: dedicated Open Access presses such as the relaunched UCL Press and Goldsmiths Press, looking to digital first to deliver new and unconventional forms of academic publishing. Meanwhile, start-ups queue up to break ground with the latest author tool or new business model. &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.oup.com/2015/11/future-scholarly-publishing/?utm_source=twitter&amp;amp;utm_medium=oupacademic&amp;amp;utm_campaign=oupblog#sthash.3KRSD5Tb.dpuf&quot;&gt;Sophie McGee&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rounded Globe&lt;/strong&gt; is one such independent endeavour, using a crowdfunded model to fund production and editing, and enabling patrons to either donate or freely download publications. The academic book is reimagined as an accessible scholarly essay, with the emphasis on communicating research and intellectual musings to a wide global audience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the words of Rounded Globe author and Cambridge scholar, Professor Alan Macfarlane: “Rounded Globe are hoping to help people like me, and other academics, to make their books more publically accessible, free, cheap, everywhere in the world.”&lt;/p&gt;
