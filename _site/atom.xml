   <title>Experiments With Books</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://roundedglobe.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rounded Globe&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; produces scholarly ebooks that can be read on kindles and tablets. Our ebooks are generated as .epub and .mobi files by an automatic process (designed by our chief technical wizard, Andrew Holgate). At the core of the compiled ebook is a simple .txt file, written in markdown (as is this blog post) and containing the body of the essay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As such, Rounded Globe follows the commercial ebook format rather than the conventional format of academic publishing, which rests on the .pdf file - essentially, a photographic image of a traditional printed page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One advantage of the commercial format is that ebooks can be very easily revised. Instead of waiting for a new edition, the .txt file is tweaked as desired and a new ebook may be automatically generated. This, in effect, negates the very idea of &amp;#39;an edition&amp;#39;, as the ebook is open to continual and open-ended revision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the same logic, of course, an &amp;#39;unfinished&amp;#39; text can readily be compiled as an ebook. In recent weeks Rounded Globe has offered a group of amateur scholars and Tolkien enthusiasts the opportunity to do just this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The group, whose members reside in locations as diverse as Tanzania and Texas, not to mention Cheshire, UK, are co-writing an essay for a forthcoming &lt;a href=&quot;http://sacnoths.blogspot.co.il/2015/05/verlyn-flieger-festschrit-call-for.html&quot;&gt;volume&lt;/a&gt; in honour of the Tolkien scholar Verlyn Flieger. For their discussions and writing they make use of a (free) &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/uoou/AWildernessOfDragons&quot;&gt;github repository&lt;/a&gt;, which allows them to make a Wiki for their project, engage in blog posts, and - crucially - write the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/uoou/AWildernessOfDragons/blob/gh-pages/essay.md&quot;&gt;essay&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Github requires the essay to be written in markdown. This means that at any moment the text of the essay can be copied and pasted into a .txt file and, using the Rounded Globe machinery, transformed into a working ebook that may be read on Kindle or on tablet or simply on the web.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rounded Globe have donated a free &amp;#39;hidden&amp;#39; &lt;a href=&quot;http://roundedglobe.com/download/56421543cf7bc42e04e564b6&quot;&gt;page&lt;/a&gt; for this project. It is &amp;#39;hidden&amp;#39; in the sense that this essay does not show up in our main list of books. But members of the group - in fact, anyone with the url - can download the latest version of the essay as an ebook whenever they want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This Tolkien project is a lot of fun, not least because it facilitates exploration of the possibilities of co-authorship. But it also points to a deeper lesson, namely that electronic text is challenging our entrenched cultural assumptions as to the nature of a book. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This challenge has long been obscured by the default academic turn to pdf ebooks (a typical case of a new technology disguising itself to look - and work - like the old). But our production model at Rounded Globe brings us face to face with the fact that the very idea of a finished and complete book has little real meaning - a book is &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; in a potential process of change and revision; like ourselves, a book that is &amp;#39;finished&amp;#39; is a dead book.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Academic Book Week &amp; Rounded Globe</title>
   <link href="http://roundedglobe.github.io/blog//academic-book-week-&-Rounded-Globe/"/>
   <updated>2015-11-11T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>http://roundedglobe.github.io/blog//academic-book-week-&-Rounded-Globe</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the new Rounded Globe blog. Our first post is a short contribution to the various musings and articles posted online regarding the future of scholarly publications during &lt;strong&gt;Academic Book Week&lt;/strong&gt; (9th – 16th Nov 2015).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Traditionally, academic books were printed monographs: extensive pieces of research, frequently written primarily for specialist audiences in discipline specific jargon. In recent times, though printed books are still popular with many, there has been a huge increase in the number of e-books in academic collections and libraries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In theory, these online publications enable access anytime, anyplace, to anyone; but in practice they yield their gems of wisdom only to those with institutional memberships or with a personal copy of the often costly books. Even with relevant university affiliations, researchers are constrained by the budgets of academic libraries, which are frustrated by their inability to purchase all of the vast array of human research and knowledge their members wish to access.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The open access movement, which has gained some momentum but not entirely overthrown existing publishing practices, aims to further widen access to the increasing selection of electronic resources, by creating new models enabling all scholars, not just those connected to universities, to be able to read digital scholarship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As many articles written for Academic Book Week have mentioned, in addition to traditional publishers creating ebooks and exploring ways of providing open access, and an increased interest in the development of open access university presses, there are also independent initiatives appearing in scholarly publishing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the other end are new entrants defining particular niches: dedicated Open Access presses such as the relaunched UCL Press and Goldsmiths Press, looking to digital first to deliver new and unconventional forms of academic publishing. Meanwhile, start-ups queue up to break ground with the latest author tool or new business model. &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.oup.com/2015/11/future-scholarly-publishing/?utm_source=twitter&amp;amp;utm_medium=oupacademic&amp;amp;utm_campaign=oupblog#sthash.3KRSD5Tb.dpuf&quot;&gt;Sophie McGee&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rounded Globe&lt;/strong&gt; is one such independent endeavour, using a crowdfunded model to fund production and editing, and enabling patrons to either donate or freely download publications. The academic book is reimagined as an accessible scholarly essay, with the emphasis on communicating research and intellectual musings to a wide global audience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the words of Rounded Globe author and Cambridge scholar, Professor Alan Macfarlane: “Rounded Globe are hoping to help people like me, and other academics, to make their books more publically accessible, free, cheap, everywhere in the world.”&lt;/p&gt;
