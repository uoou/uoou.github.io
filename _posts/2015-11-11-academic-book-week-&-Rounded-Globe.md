Welcome to the new Rounded Globe blog. Our first post is a short contribution to the various musings and articles posted online regarding the future of scholarly publications during **Academic Book Week** (9th – 16th Nov 2015).

Traditionally, academic books were printed monographs: extensive pieces of research, frequently written primarily for specialist audiences in discipline specific jargon. In recent times, though printed books are still popular with many, there has been a huge increase in the number of e-books in academic collections and libraries.

In theory, these online publications enable access anytime, anyplace, to anyone; but in practice they yield their gems of wisdom only to those with institutional memberships or with a personal copy of the often costly books. Even with relevant university affiliations, researchers are constrained by the budgets of academic libraries, which are frustrated by their inability to purchase all of the vast array of human research and knowledge their members wish to access.

The open access movement, which has gained some momentum but not entirely overthrown existing publishing practices, aims to further widen access to the increasing selection of electronic resources, by creating new models enabling all scholars, not just those connected to universities, to be able to read digital scholarship.

As many articles written for Academic Book Week have mentioned, in addition to traditional publishers creating ebooks and exploring ways of providing open access, and an increased interest in the development of open access university presses, there are also independent initiatives appearing in scholarly publishing.

> At the other end are new entrants defining particular niches: dedicated Open Access presses such as the relaunched UCL Press and Goldsmiths Press, looking to digital first to deliver new and unconventional forms of academic publishing. Meanwhile, start-ups queue up to break ground with the latest author tool or new business model.

**Rounded Globe** is one such independent endeavour, using a crowdfunded model to fund production and editing, and enabling patrons to either donate or freely download publications. The academic book is reimagined as an accessible scholarly essay, with the emphasis on communicating research and intellectual musings to a wide global audience.

In the words of Rounded Globe author and Cambridge scholar, Professor Alan Macfarlane: “Rounded Globe are hoping to help people like me, and other academics, to make their books more publically accessible, free, cheap, everywhere in the world.”
