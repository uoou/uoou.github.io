[**Rounded Globe**](http://roundedglobe.com/) produces scholarly ebooks that can be read on kindles and tablets. Our ebooks are generated as .epub and .mobi files by an automatic process (designed by our chief technical wizard, Andrew Holgate). At the core of the compiled ebook is a simple .txt file, written in markdown (as is this blog post) and containing the body of the essay.

As such, Rounded Globe follows the commercial ebook format rather than the conventional format of academic publishing, which rests on the .pdf file - essentially, a photographic image of a traditional printed page.

One advantage of the commercial format is that ebooks can be very easily revised. Instead of waiting for a new edition, the .txt file is tweaked as desired and a new ebook may be automatically generated. This, in effect, negates the very idea of 'an edition', as the ebook is open to continual and open-ended revision.

By the same logic, of course, an 'unfinished' text can readily be compiled as an ebook. In recent weeks Rounded Globe has offered a group of amateur scholars and Tolkien enthusiasts the opportunity to do just this.

The group, whose members reside in locations as diverse as Tanzania and Texas, not to mention Cheshire, UK, are co-writing an essay for a forthcoming [volume](http://sacnoths.blogspot.co.il/2015/05/verlyn-flieger-festschrit-call-for.html) in honour of the Tolkien scholar Verlyn Flieger. For their discussions and writing they make use of a (free) [github repository](https://github.com/uoou/AWildernessOfDragons), which allows them to make a Wiki for their project, engage in blog posts, and - crucially - write the [essay](https://github.com/uoou/AWildernessOfDragons/blob/gh-pages/essay.md). 

Github requires the essay to be written in markdown. This means that at any moment the text of the essay can be copied and pasted into a .txt file and, using the Rounded Globe machinery, transformed into a working ebook that may be read on Kindle or on tablet or simply on the web.

Rounded Globe have donated a free 'hidden' [page](http://roundedglobe.com/download/56421543cf7bc42e04e564b6) for this project. It is 'hidden' in the sense that this essay does not show up in our main list of books. But members of the group - in fact, anyone with the url - can download the latest version of the essay as an ebook whenever they want.

This Tolkien project is a lot of fun, not least because it facilitates exploration of the possibilities of co-authorship. But it also points to a deeper lesson, namely that electronic text is challenging our entrenched cultural assumptions as to the nature of a book. 

This challenge has long been obscured by the default academic turn to pdf ebooks (a typical case of a new technology disguising itself to look - and work - like the old). But our production model at Rounded Globe brings us face to face with the fact that the very idea of a finished and complete book has little real meaning - a book is *always* in a potential process of change and revision; like ourselves, a book that is 'finished' is a dead book.
